### Useful resources

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) - This helped me with some doubts I had about SASS.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article that helped me a lot to understand about the properties of flexbox. I recommend it to anyone who is still learning about it.
